# Automatic-Plant-Watering-System with Raspberry Pi
 (In this tutorial the moisture sensor will be made from scratch. The sensor will be more robust compared to a lot of commercial sensors that tend to oxidise! Although you can alternatively purchase a ready made sensor. Otherwise, check out the wiki to assemble the sensor :))

## Material you will need:
### Single board computer and expansions
 - Raspberry Pi
 - Explorer hat pro
 - Micro SD card and Micro SD adapter
### Water pump materials
 - Submersible water pump (no more than 5V)
 - Tubing for the water pump
 - Jumper wires (optional)
 - Container/pot to hold wter and store the water pump
### Moisture sensor materials
 - Galvanised screws (2x)
 - 10k ohm resistor
 - Jumper wires
 
## Software Set Up Steps (for Linux systems - Ubuntu/Debian-based):
### - Encrypt MicroSD card with Raspberry Pi OS
  - You can do this from the Raspberry Pi official website using the micro SD adapter - download the imager
  - You can now set up the Raspberry Pi hardware - in the hardware set up steps
### - Install python
#### open up the terminal and run the following commands in your virtual environment:
- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install python3
- sudo apt install python3-pip
- python3 --version
#### if the python version is shown, python has successfully been installed
### - Install R - optional, you can also parse data in python
 - follow this website to download the correct version of R for you: https://cran.r-project.org/
### - Install virtual environment
#### Set up a virtual environment to set up your automatic watering system, following the commands:
- sudo apt install python3-venv
- mkdir Automatic_Watering_System
- cd Automatic_Watering_System
- python -m venv myenv
#### within "myenv" (source myenv/bin/activate) you avoid virtual environment interfering with the system Python or other environments
### - Install Explorer Hat Pro
#### Install the explorer hat pro library in the virtual environment:
- pip install explorerhat

## Hardware Set Up Steps - Set up the Raspberry Pi
### - MicroSD
 - insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi SD slot
### - Explorer Hat Pro
 - insert the 40 pin GPIO connector ontop of the pins on the Raspberry Pi
 - stick the bread board ontop of the Explorer Hat Pro
### - Wires, monitor, keyboard, and mouse
 - connect the power supply to the Raspberry Pi power port
 - connect the HDMI cable to the Raspberry Pi HDMI port and the other end to the computer monitor port
 - connect the keyboard and mouse to the Raspberry Pi using the USB port 
 - your Raspberry Pi can now be accessed
#### find the rest of the hardware steps to make the sensor, modify the pump, and set up the parts on the Raspberry Pi in the wiki tutorial!

## Test Runs Using Repository Scripts (after complete hardware set up)
 - Copy the github repository into your virtual enviornment using the clone link
### - To check that the explorer hat has been connected to the 40 pin GPIO connector on the Raspberry Pi correctly:
#### Make sure you have placed the hat with the bread board ontop of the Pi before the next step
##### Run the command: 
- python test_explorerhat.py
##### You should see all three LED colours flash and a message to you
### - To check that the water pump has been connected to the motor port correctly:
#### Place the water pump inside a container with water and the plastic tubing inside a recipient container 
#### Run the command: 
- python test_pump.py
##### The terminal should show you two messages and water should be pumped into the empty container for 5 seconds
### - To check that the moisture sensor has been made correctly and connected to the analog one, output one and ground correctly
#### Make sure all the jumper wires are in the correct terminals and the screws are inside the soil of your plant
#### Run the command:
- python test_sensor.py 
##### The terminal should show you a message and the voltage from your sensor
### - To check that the sensor and pump communicate correctly
#### Run the command:
- python test_pump_sensor_communication.py
##### If the pump and sensor communicate successfully, you should see messages on the terminal, the voltage unit, and (if the plant needs watering) the pump switched on
